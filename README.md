Attempted geopandas file of Police data
This was my attemped version of the geopandas file
I could not figure out how to edit the files to show the different priorities like in Python
I also had issues on creating a loop like in Python to count the incidents 
    I was not sure whether it was necessary or not. Without it, it does write the density as below 1
